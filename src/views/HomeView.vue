              I have a strong passion for video game development. I'm fascinated by
              every aspect of the process, from designing a story or gameplay
              mechanic to bringing it to life. I enjoy creating environments,
              developing user interfaces, and programming the interactive dynamics
              that make each game unique. Iâ€™m currently studying the Unity3D engine
              and enjoy creating Pixel Art in my free time.
