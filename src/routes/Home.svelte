          Passionate about computer science, with a strong interest in

          I have a strong passion for video game development. I'm fascinated by
          every aspect of the process, from designing a story or gameplay
          mechanic to bringing it to life. I enjoy creating environments,
          developing user interfaces, and programming the interactive dynamics
          that make each game unique. Iâ€™m currently studying the Unity3D engine
          and enjoy creating Pixel Art in my free time.
